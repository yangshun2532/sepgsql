The security policy module of SE-PostgreSQL
-------------------------------------------

o Introduction

  We provide two kind of security policy modules.

  One is "sepostgresql.pp" which contains full-set of security policy
  and suitable for legacy base policy (selinux-policy-3.4.1, or prior).

  The other is "sepostgresql-devel.pp" which provides several booleans
  for developers, and suitable for newer base policy (selinux-policy-3.4.2,
  or later).

  In the selinux-policy-3.4.2, most part of the policy got upstreamed.
  So, we don't need to install "sepostgresql.pp" explicitly on the newer
  base security policy.

  If you need to run regression test, or (don't) want to generate access
  logs, install "sepostgresql-devel.pp" and turn on/off booleans.

o Build & Installation

  $ cd src/backend/security/sepgsql/policy
  $ make
  $ su
  # /usr/sbin/semodule -i sepostgresql-devel.pp
      or
  #  /usr/sbin/semodule -i sepostgresql.pp

o Booleans

- sepgsql_enable_users_ddl (default: on)
  This boolean enables to control to execute DDL statement come from
  confined users.

- sepgsql_enable_auditallow (default: off)
  This boolean enables to generate access allow logs except for tuple
  level.

- sepgsql_enable_auditdeny (default: on)
  This boolean enables to generata access denied logs except for tuple
  level.

- sepgsql_regression_test_mode (default: off)
  This boolean provides several permission to run regression test on
  your home directory. It enables to load shared library files deployed
  on home directory.
  However, we don't recommend it to turn on in the operation phase.
