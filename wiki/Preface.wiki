== What is SE-PostgreSQL ==
Security Enhanced PostgreSQL (SE-PostgreSQL) is an extension of PostgreSQL relational database management system, based on Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux)'s security model and policy.
It can provide fine grained mandatory access control to various database objects such as tables, columns or tuples and can apply consistent authority of remote/local client integrated with operation system independent from database authorization.
These facilities enable to build a database management system into information flow control scheme integrated with operating system. It helps to protect your information asset from some of threats like leaking, defacing and destruction.

 This project is supported by [http://www.ipa.go.jp/english/humandev/third.html Exploratory Software Project (2006FY)] of IPA (Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan).
