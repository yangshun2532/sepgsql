Detailed Changelog in Common Abstraction Layer for Access Controls
------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this memo is to keep when/what code was changed for
the what purpose, for the future tracking.
Needless to say, access control facility can be updated with our
efforts in the future. In generally, if user get an inconsistent
access control decision with the same condition on the different
versions, it will be unacceptable without any clear reason.
However, we may have no other choice to see some minor behavior
changes, such as order to check error conditions. 
For example, when an operation resolves name of the object and
check access permission on the object, it depends on the
implementaions which error should be detected earlier.

This memo notes these behavior changes corresponding to access
control features, which are too details for release notes.
